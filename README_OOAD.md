# ♟ Kwazam Chess – CCP6224 OOAD Project (Trimester 2410)

Kwazam Chess is a Java-based turn-based chess game developed as part of the **Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD)** coursework at **Multimedia University (MMU)**. The project emphasizes object-oriented architecture, design patterns, and user interaction through a simple graphical interface.

## 🧩 Project Highlights

- Implements **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture for modularity.
- Integrates **Observer Design Pattern** for real-time UI updates.
- Features game-saving, loading, and state persistence.
- Supports piece selection, movement, capture, reset, and exit.
- Built in Java using only standard libraries (no external frameworks).

## 📁 Project Structure

```bash
📁 Kwazam_Chess/
├── run.java            # Main entry point of the application
├── *.java              # Supporting Java classes (Model, View, Controller, etc.)
├── *.class             # Compiled Java bytecode (optional)
```

## 🖥️ How to Compile and Run

### 🔧 Windows (Command Prompt)

```bash
cd path/to/Kwazam_Chess
javac run.java
